     <p> My project was about how certain sounds are similar to sounds made in songs. I was listening to a this song while thinking about what I should do for my film project and I realized that I had clips that fit to this song so I thought of ways to fit the beat.<p>
       <p> My other video is a transition between two different scenes. I wanted to get a change of speed.
